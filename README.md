# Smart Images for ExactTarget
Smart Images are my attempt at creating a Live Images-like solution that allows users to interact w/ the behavior of the links/images via the API. ince all of the data is maintained within a data extension it can be easily accessed and manipulated through the API, but a handy little dashboard is included too in case you'd like to interact with it via a GUI.

## Prerequisites
The only things required to get rolling are:

+		An ExactTarget account
+		Microsites (or Landing Pages)
+		Content Areas (the "My Contents" folder)
+		A Data Extension with the structure:
	+		dealId - Text - Primary Key
	+		dealDescription - Text
	+		dealGoodImageUrl - Text
	+		dealExpiredImageUrl - Text
	+		dealGoodLinkUrl - Text
	+		dealExpiredLinkUrl - Text
	+		active - Boolean
	+		published - Boolean
